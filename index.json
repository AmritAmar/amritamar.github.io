These games are prototypes - rough, unpolished, and only testing gameplay. By creating these prototypes I hope to gain a better understanding of vaious game design elements and how game designers create memorable, exciting, and fun games.\nPersonally, I think pure turn-based games are a little bit draining to me. I love watching people play them and I love analyzing and understanding the meta behind them but playing them on my own feels a little lack-luster. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because I prefer seeing things resolve simultaneously. I love seeing the action happen because of my decisions - the tense moment of making a choice and waiting for the effect to play out on my screen is exhilirating and fun! This is the main reason behind making \u0026ldquo;Punch!\u0026rdquo;. I wanted to explore the feeling of making quick choices and hoping that you out-smarted your opponent.\nPlay the game here! (hit the play button on the top left!)\nPunch is a multiplayer game! Open the game with a friend (or across 2 browsers), ensure the \u0026lsquo;CLIENT_CODE\u0026rsquo; is the same, along with the realtime parameter set to what you\u0026rsquo;d like to try (true or false)! Then hit the \u0026lsquo;click me\u0026rsquo; button below the main game window. The main game is played by getting your fist to touch the enemy\u0026rsquo;s head. Do this by dragging on your body parts in a particular direction to add a \u0026lsquo;force\u0026rsquo; to it.\n realtime = true: The game is played in real-time with actions happening continuosly. Control the joints of your robot one-by-one and be the first to win!   realtime = false: The game is played in 3 second intervals. You can control the joints of your robot and set each specific \u0026lsquo;force\u0026rsquo; individually! After 3 seconds, the forces resolve and you get to make your next choices!  A little touch on the technical details: I used matter.js as my physics engine and socket to communicate with a glitch server! I send over the positions and velocity of the character based on requests from the server and synchronize them across connected clients. Yes, this means that this game is \u0026lsquo;client-sided\u0026rsquo; and you could cheat by overriding those values. Creating a client-sided game would have been easier but that\u0026rsquo;s a future project for another day.\nFrom playtesting, one of the most interesting things to explore was \u0026lsquo;who had the beatdown\u0026rsquo; (i.e. who had the advantage in a game). There is a steady flow to the game where players have to identify who is the one in the attacking (beat-down) spot and who is the one in the defending (control) spot. As these switched turn after turn, the concept of turns existing in real-time games makes sense - tempo is an important concept in several games. Performance and networking issues aside, playtesters thought it was a really fun game. A meta developed where players would basically protect themselves completely and then send their robot flying at the opponent with the hands in front.\n","date":1621555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621555200,"objectID":"47a1ee3da21db677f9d7e637cd68ead1","permalink":"https://amritamar.github.io/project/gameprototypes_punch/","publishdate":"2021-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gameprototypes_punch/","section":"project","summary":"A multiplayer game about landing a punch before your opponent does.","tags":["Personal","Game Design"],"title":"Game Prototypes - Punch!","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r This was a tiny project I made as a primer to explain rendering to a younger cousin of mine! In the sketch above, I cast rays from a randomly moving point and check whether there is a line-line intersection with any of the walls. If there is (and it is the closest), we use that point as an anchor to draw the ray to. This is basic version of how shadows and lighting is done in 2D games.\n\r In the next sketch, I rendered the rays cast out to a simple 3D scene. Each ray create a \u0026lsquo;slice\u0026rsquo; of the view camera (there aren\u0026rsquo;t that many which is why it isn\u0026rsquo;t smooth). The box size and color brightness decreases with distance (using the inverse square law). On the top of the sketch window, you can change the FOV. I thought about making boxes instead of lines but I really like how the lines look with higher FOVs and create some weird illusions.\nThis was a simple look into writing a really quick renderer and simple ray tracer.

These games are prototypes - rough, unpolished, and only testing gameplay. By creating these prototypes I hope to gain a better understanding of vaious game design elements and how game designers create memorable, exciting, and fun games.\nA game of chance is a card game about calculated risk. I envision this game being played in a dark setting - you vs the world. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been fascinated by repeated games like poker, where your success is measured over numerous plays rather than just a singular encounter. One of my favorite strategy games, Teamfight Tactics, is also like this. I think games with variance have high replayability (see Roguelikes) and create really fun situations that challenge the player to (1) think about what they\u0026rsquo;re dealt and, more importantly, (2) how to make the best use of the situation. While this game isn\u0026rsquo;t that complicated, I wanted to recreate that feeling of high-stakes decision making.\nPlay the game here! (hit the play button on the top left!)\nHow to Play: - In front of you are 9 cards. There are 8 numbered cards (2-9) and 1 death card.\n Every time you opt to turn over a card, you wager 1 gold (this is what the \u0026ldquo;Current\u0026rdquo; means on the UI).\n If you hit a number card, continue! If you hit the death card, you will lose what you wagered + 2 gold.\n If you uncover everything, you win everything you wagered. If you pass the game, you will gain want you wagered - 2 gold.\n In addition, there are power ups to help you! If you get 3 in a row or column, you can use a power up to help you.\n (+) powerup allows you to select any card that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been turned over and you will get a hint as to what the card could be above.\n (\u0026gt;) powerup allows you to select any uncovered card and reveals whether neighbor cards are higher or lower than the chosen card.\n In addition, you can guess where the death card is at any point by hitting the \u0026ldquo;GUESS D\u0026rdquo; button. If you successfully guess, you will gain, in addition to what you wagered, 3 times the number of remaining cards. If you fail, you will lose what you wagered + 10 gold.\n  After having playtests with some of my friends, I got a lot of feedback on the concept. They said that once they got the hang of the game, \u0026lsquo;passing\u0026rsquo; after getting 4-5 cards correct will nearly always net you a win in the long run. They liked that the stakes only increased when you \u0026lsquo;committed\u0026rsquo; more to the game and that losing by getting unlucky didn\u0026rsquo;t feel bad. Some playtesters felt that \u0026lsquo;passing\u0026rsquo; shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be a part of the game at all. When I tested the game by removing the \u0026lsquo;passing\u0026rsquo;, playtesters felt like they got really unlucky sometimes towards the end which killed their mood if it happened repeatedly. While they liked the powerups, almost all playtesters said that the (+) powerup felt too weak since you could technically get a (2+) on a 7 or 8 which didn\u0026rsquo;t really help them.\nIn the future, a more complete game would probably include a \u0026lsquo;bank\u0026rsquo; of money that you wager (so that there\u0026rsquo;s a concrete lose condition) along with more powerups and perhaps a bigger board (4x3 or 4x4).\n","date":1604448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604448000,"objectID":"4f775e8c91f8664ece7ad94ea1fdaa39","permalink":"https://amritamar.github.io/project/gameprototypes_gameofchance/","publishdate":"2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gameprototypes_gameofchance/","section":"project","summary":"A card game you play when you face death itself.","tags":["Personal","Game Design"],"title":"Game Prototypes - A Game of Chance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is the final project my team and I worked on in advanced artificial intelligence. I give a brief summary of what we did throughout the semester. Unfortunately, I can\u0026rsquo;t release the code as per Cornell regulations, but feel free to read the final paper on the project (linked above), along with the data. All the following pictures were generated by computers!\nCommunication isn’t perfect. Perhaps the room is too noisy or one party is distracted with another task but people often don’t understand each other perfectly; however, communication between people doesn’t break down. Similarly, in writing, we can still make out what the author intended to write on a piece of paper despite stains or wear down. We explore the question, can neural networks encode a language robust enough to be transmitted through noise channels and recreate the original meaning?\nOur goal in this project was to study the robustness of neural networks in encoding a language to communicate with one another. We used neural networks to generate images given vectors and transmitted those images over a noisy channel of communication. Another neural network received these images and decoded the image back to its vector representation.\nOur model is based on the Shannon-Weaver model of communication where the transmitter and receiver roles are played by two neural networks. G encodes a message. D decodes that message. As the networks get better at communicating, we increase the noise in the communication channel.\nWe did the following experiments: - Compare Grayscale and RGB output of networks - Compare the impact of the size of output images between Grayscale models - Compare the impact of the size of output images between RGB models - The impact of noise on a larger dataset on grayscale networks. - Qualitative Evaluation of RGB 64x64 Model with GloVe vectors\nThe first picture in this article belongs to a greyscale model outputting 36 8x8 images (A-Z, 0-9). The picture below is a color model outputting 36 8x8 images.\nExample 64x64 pictures. Greyscale:\nColor:\nWe also did word embeddings using Twitter\u0026rsquo;s GloVe embeddings:\nAn explanation of our experiments and more data can be found in the source can be found on our source page above.\nOverall, qualitatively, our models created images that look distinct from one another. For several of the one-hot models, we can clearly see differences between various encodings, similar to how we see differences between characters of various alphabets. The difference between real life communication and our model is that real life communication is based on alphabets that are defined by outlines and real images, while our models simply try to fill in a box with colors. It would be interesting to extend this project to generate scribbles rather than defined images. Interestingly, the lower the dimension of the generated image, the closer it resembles our own letters. Perhaps with smaller dimensions and more limitations, we could get something that resembles our own alphabet.\n","date":1590019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590019200,"objectID":"852b1c55423d216ec4088aa8b87036e4","permalink":"https://amritamar.github.io/project/visualizinglanguageovernoise/","publishdate":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/visualizinglanguageovernoise/","section":"project","summary":"A GANs Project for CS 6700 (Advanced Artificial Intelligence).","tags":["Cornell","AI"],"title":"Visualizing Language over Noise","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Games2Anime is a website that recommends Anime based on Steam Games.\nDue to current world events (COVID-19), there is a greater demand for online entertainment. Steam recently reached a record high for concurrent users and more people than ever are consuming online entertainment. However, there are only so many games on Steam and many gamers may seek to broaden their horizons by trying something new, like Japanese animation (anime). However, it can be difficult to narrow what anime to watch due to its wide variety of genres and styles.\nThus, the goal of our application is to recommend anime to people based on their Steam gaming preferences. By giving our system a game title from Steam, it will return a list of recommended anime based on the similarity in reviews and game description. Each recommendation displays general details and a similarity rating, along with a link to its MyAnimeList page.\nIt works by comparing Steam Game Descriptions and Anime User Reviews to give you a list of Anime recommendations.\nGames2Anime gets a list of all Anime with a MAL rating of 7.0 or above. We then remove any sequels/related movies from the list (to ensure we don\u0026rsquo;t recommend more than 1 show from a particular series on a search). We get the top 20 reviews for each anime in our list (sorted by most helpful reviews first). We then combine all the reviews and use a fancy tool called TfidfVectorizer that converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. We then perform dimensionality reduction using singular value decomposition (svds) to get a matrices of words in reviews and anime based on words. We these structures, we can find similar anime to words using cosine similarity.\nWe then get a list of all Steam Games and their descriptions. Based on the game input, we go through each word in the game\u0026rsquo;s description and get the top anime to that word and build up a ranking based on how often an anime shows up across the entire description. After normalizing and sorting the scores, we return the top 5 anime recommendations based on the game.\nBecause we are heavily reliant on keyword matching, some keywords get over weighted and thus we have to manually decrease the weight of certain keywords. Sometimes this affects \u0026lsquo;obvious\u0026rsquo; results like getting basketball anime for a game about basketball. This is ongoing so some search results are not great, yet. In the future, it would be nice to have search result feedback, either using Rocchio or another method.

It is a remake of an old game called GeoSense, made by a reddit user, u/mattfel. I heard about this game through a r/webgames thread.\nDespite memorizing capitals once in my life, it turns out that I am very bad at the game. After losing a few rounds really badly, I decided to use an afternoon to make a program to beat the game for me. There were 3 things needed:\n Reading the place given to players Looking up where that place is (latitude/longitude coordinates) Moving the mouse to where the place is on the world map  I decided to use Python-tesseract, a wrapper for Google\u0026rsquo;s Tesseract OCR Engine. It can read image files and output the text on the images. To get the image itself, I used something called PyAutoGUI, a library that automates GUI features, to capture a screenshot given coordinates on the screen. To get those coordinates, I needed keyboard input and thus required pynput, a library that controls input devices. When setting up the program, the user has to give coordinates on the screen of where the text of the location to look up will show up. Thus, we can get an image of the text and passing it into pytesseract, we get the location in string.\nTo look up where the place is, I used a libary called geopy. Geopy has OpenStreetMap\u0026rsquo;s Nominatum which allows me to get the latitude and longitude of a place given an address. Thus, all it needed was a simple function to look up the latitude/longitude of a given location. The lookup took less than 1 second in most cases as well.\nFinally, to move the mouse to the given latitude and longitude on the GeoScents map, I used PyAutoGUI. However I ran into a problem - the map given wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely correct (the equator was much lower than the center of the map). Because this was a hack and not something that needed immense precision (and because GeoScents lets you guess the location within a radius), I decided to forego precision for convenience and instead allowed the user to input 2 known locations and extrapolated where the mouse would be given the scaling. I chose the equator and the Cape of Good Hope as the two places needed to be selected. Once the screen coordinates are received, the program automatically finds the conversion from latitude/longitude coordinates to pixels and thus converts the location coordinates to pixel coordinates on screen.\nAll of the above is wrapped up into a button (in a GUID made with TkInter) which when clicked performs the above 3 steps and automatically moves your cursor to the location on the map. You can adjust for precision based on your knowledge but I just click because I trust the program more than my highschool geography. The program works well when calibrated correctly (correct coordinates for text, equator, and Cape of Good Hope) and achives really high scores! There are a couple of times where the program fails because of smaller text and propagated errors from the calibration. Currently the program only works for the world map. In the future, I hope I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to make it work for all the maps on GeoScents.\n","date":1578441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578441600,"objectID":"ab2fc9ee34732066cf1470ce235b29d6","permalink":"https://amritamar.github.io/project/geoscentshack/","publishdate":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/geoscentshack/","section":"project","summary":"A program I wrote to beat GeoScents.","tags":["Personal","Game Design"],"title":"Hacking GeoScents","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is the final project my team and I worked on in graduate computer vision. I give a brief summary of what we did throughout the semester. Unfortunately, I can\u0026rsquo;t release the code as per Cornell regulations, but feel free to read the final paper on the project (linked above). All the following pictures were generated by computers!\nOur goal in this project is to see if it is possible to generate human poses using GANs. We draw inspiration from the paper, Generating Videos with Scene Dynamics, which proposed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for videos that untangle the scene\u0026rsquo;s foreground from the background, also known as VideoGAN. VideoGAN generated videos that, while not photo-realistic, display motions that were fairly reasonable for the scenes it was trained on. Specifically, we explored generating poses by understanding human dancing, by training our models on the Let’s Dance Dataset. We evaluated how well VideoGAN is able to output dance video and we proposed a new architecture called VectorGAN that takes the vector representations of people dancing and generates videos.\nOur intention in this project was to explore how computers can capture motion and generate it. By generating motion from a given frame, we can generate \u0026lsquo;future\u0026rsquo; motion. There are lots of applications for generating “future” video such as video understanding and simulations and animation (specifically in Rigging avatars to automatically create ranges of motion). Given a starting image, we wanted to make predictions about certain events. We used dancing because human motion is fluid and defined in dancing, and the dataset we used was clearly categorized.\nWe implemented the following:\n VideoGAN Architecture - 32 Frames of Video Modified VideoGAN Architecture - 128 Frames of Video VectorGAN Architecture with Random Noise - 32 Frames of Video VectorGAN Architecture with Starting Vector - 32 Frames of Video VectorGAN Architecture Composited Video (using previous experiment) - 128 Frames of Video  VideoGAN: following the inspiration paper, Generating Videos with Scene Dynamics, we implemented their model and generated 32 frames of video. We then modified their architecture and generated 128 frames of video. Overall, from the output video, this model does well in making a figure of a human doing a dance move. However, it is very noisy. We expected this from a model that takes in raw pixels. This also happened in the second experiment where, even though the generated dance video was longer, it was still blurry. However, VideoGAN recognized people and captured some of their movements (blue is 32 frames, green is 128 frames).\nVectorGAN: using the dance video\u0026rsquo;s vector representation, we trained our model on the positions of human parts. Although VectorGAN had to be trained on more epochs to get something smooth, this method worked pretty well. The generated vector positions through time resemble a lot of the motion that ballet dancers do. It is interesting to note that the model figured out how the different limbs of humans connect to each other after about 100 epochs but needed much more to generate coherent movement. There are still a lot of places where the dancer’s limbs jerk, but we attribute this to the shortcomings of the dataset we used; not every single frame had a coherent human structure and some frames had nothing. We then tested the VectorGAN with an encoder added on to the beginning of the architecture that had the starting vectors of the input video. We then used this in the composited video experiment, where we generated 128 frame videos by feeding the last frame of a generated 32 frame video into the model 3 times (random noise, starting vector, and 128 frames in that order below).\nOverall, VideoGAN and VectorGAN provide tangible results in generating videos of human pose. However, the frames generated VideoGAN were of very low resolution as computing images of stick figures is still very difficult. VectorGAN had much better results as we could animate together distinct key points to see the figure move more clearly. Our conclusion is that generating human pose is possible with VectorGAN, but we don’t have nearly enough training data. The original VideoGAN paper used over 35 million clips while we used only 84 videos for training our models. However, the results we got are promising. We only used the ballet dances from the dataset, but it would be interesting (and very time consuming) to see how the model does on other dances.\n","date":1576713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576713600,"objectID":"55590df8f5ee2fb7d405c6f923e8e0dd","permalink":"https://amritamar.github.io/project/dancegans/","publishdate":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dancegans/","section":"project","summary":"A GANs Project for CS 6670 (Graduate Computer Vision).","tags":["Cornell","AI"],"title":"Everybody GANs Now!","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This was a project I made after starting to learn javascript using p5.js. I really like the idea of how code can be used to visualize abstract math concepts (and show what exactly is happening in the background) and I hope to continue making more visualizations using code in the future. First a few references: I got interested in fourier transforms after watching 3Blue1Brown\u0026rsquo;s video on the topic. I also saw this really cool and interactive introduction to the topic by @jezzamonn. Finally, I learnt javascript (and most of this project) by watching Daniel Shiffman\u0026rsquo;s Coding Challenges!\nWhat is a fourier transform? It\u0026rsquo;s simply a way of breaking apart a wave into individual components. This is most used in signal processing, specifically in the audio area. One of the coolest things you can do with fourier transforms is extract specific sounds and tune them however you like! So for example, if you had a music clip with a bit of fuzzy noise in the background, you can use a fourier transform on the clip and get the individual sound waves. After finding the one causing the fuzzy noise, you can remove it. Combine the remaining waves and voila - you have a sound clip without that fuzzy sound.\nFollowing Daniel Shiffman\u0026rsquo;s tutorial, I first started with visualizing the fourier series. I visualized the square wave and the sawtooth wave. You can adjust the sliders to increase/reduce the number of epicycles, and use the dropdown menu to change the wave in question.\n\r Signals, or waves, can be interpreted as a set of points. One for the X axis, and one for the Y axis. If we apply the fourier transform to both of them, we can 2 transforms that give us the frequence, phase, and amplitude of each component. This is what I did in the next iteration!\n\r I then, instead of simply drawing a circle from a set of points, implemented the ability to create the signal/drawing yourself! Once you finish drawing, the program does a fourier transform, breaking your drawing into X and Y components. Try it out - click and draw something!\n\r The final part of this project involved combining the 2 parts, X and Y components, into 1 Complex Number component. This allows you to use only one overall circle to draw both parts of the transform as the complex number component captures both X and Y of the drawing. Try the final version out!\nIn addition:\n use A/D to reduce/increase the number of epicycles used\n use W/S to increase/reduce the speed\n  \u0026hellip; and see how it affects the fourier transform!\n\r I love the way code can be used to visualize math concepts.

It is a image generation program that uses primitive shapes to generate images using genetic algorithms.\nOur intention was to complete a project exploring the concept of genetic algorithms within artificial intelligence. Genetic Algorithms use the concept of natural selection to find a minima to a function. In this case, the genetic algorithm tries to replicate a picture using only primitive shapes and tries to bring the generated picture as close to the real picture as possible.\nTo generate the image, we can adjust the number of shapes, the mutation rate, and the types/combinations of shapes to use in the generated image: - Circles (mutate the position, radius, color) - Ellipses (mutate the position, width, height, color) - Rectangles (mutate the position, width, height, color) - Pixels (n-pixels long squares, mutate the pixel position, color) - n-sided polygons\nOur implementation focuses on using a single-parent. This means that during each generation, only one picture is used to create all the children. A parent is replaced when one of the children has a better fitness score (or worse, rather). Our fitness function work by comparing the child to the original image pixel by pixel.\nThe pseudocode for our genetic algorithm is as follows:\n Generate a random image based on user-defined configurations, mainly number of shapes and types of shapes to use. Every ‘individual’ image has a ‘DNA’ that is a collection of shapes. These shapes are randomly generated and are assigned random colors. This individual image’s fitness score is also calculated here. We then generate a new image with a certain mutation rate. This new image will have random differences from the parent image (differences ranging from changing the shapes’ position or dimensions to changing the shapes’ color). The new image is then compared with the original image. We then compare the new image’s fitness score with the parent’s fitness score. If the image’s fitness score is lower than that of the parent image (i.e, there is less error in this image, thus the new image is closer to the original picture than the parent image), then we update the parent image to be the new image. If the fitness score is higher than the parent’s score, then we simply keep the same parent for the next generation. Go to part 2 and repeat until fitness score of the parent is 0.  Example 1: Eiffel Tower: Target Picture: Starting the Algorithm: After a bit of time: After a long time: Notice how the sky gradient is captured by the generated picture, simply by the adjustment of the alpha of overlapping shapes!\nOver time, the error in the generated images decreases. Of course, this happens over thousands of generations. As we used our program with a multitude of images, we noticed that some shapes converge to target images better than other shapes. For the full evaluation, check out our report.\nExample 2: Mona Lisa: Target Picture: Starting the Algorithm: After a bit of time: After a long time: Surprisingly, the algorithm seems to capture the background really well! Of course, facial features will take quite a while to develop as there is not much of a pixel difference from this image and one with facial features.\n","date":1525910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525910400,"objectID":"e0a1d0dbe530c5e5b230b8501a15d129","permalink":"https://amritamar.github.io/project/geneticimages/","publishdate":"2018-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/geneticimages/","section":"project","summary":"A project I made for CS 4701 (Practicium in Artificial Intelligence).","tags":["Cornell","AI"],"title":"Genetic Images","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a hand that can be used to do a lot of things.

The Arduino is a microprocessor that basically reads from code uploaded to it from a computer (C/C++ Code) and therefore through the use of Digital and Analog I/O pins, executes the code. Flex Sensors are Variable Resistors that change values depending on how much they are bent by. Servo Motors are precision DC motors that can be controlled to point to the exact angle from 0 to 180 Degrees.\nWhat basically happens here is that the Flex Sensor readings are inputs through the Analog Pins. It is processed and mapped to a angle. The angle is then written to the Servo Motors, thus turning them and therefore moving the fingers. There are also two buttons that control a LED and a Speaker. On the breadboard, there is an LDR (Light dependent resistor) that basically measure the amount of light in a room. Using those values, it gives a green light or a yellow light. The Arduino can be used to do a lot of things!\nIn the future, we hope to develop a better working hand with all fingers working and an opposable thumb. This would allow us to hold things. The next stage of this project is to finish the hand and make sure it can pick up things.\nWe won first place at a National Competition (The Botho College ICT Linkz Challenge 2014) with this project.
